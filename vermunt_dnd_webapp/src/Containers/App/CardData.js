		name: 	"Game Dice",
		cont: 	"The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of \
				sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in \
				many bookstores.\n\
				In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the \
				letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, \
				d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the \
				typical cube that many games use).\n\
				Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You \
				generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two \
				different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die \
				(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and \
				the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for \
				example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.\n\
				Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, \
				and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit \
				from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, \
				and 00 and 0 is 100.\n\
				When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many \
				dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to \
				add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eightsided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.\n\
				The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” \
				and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide \
				the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of \
				1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending \
				on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the \
				die, it’s a 2.)",

		name: 	"The D20",
		cont: 	"Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just \
				bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an \
				outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging \
				river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, \
				or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In \
				cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the \
				Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided \
				die, a d20, to determine success or failure.\n\
				Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are \
				Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, \
				and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for \
				most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as \
				1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability \
				modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost \
				every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or \
				monster’s behalf.\n\
				Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the \
				three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the \
				rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.\n\
				1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add \
				the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes \
				includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and \
				how to determine an ability’s modifier.)\n\
				2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A \
				class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some \
				other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.\n\
				3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total \
				equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, \
				attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a \
				failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target \
				numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, \
				attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.\n\
				The target number for an ability check or a saving \
				throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).\n\
				This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks \
				in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for \
				using the d20 in the game.",
